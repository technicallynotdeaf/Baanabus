After getting sick of inflammatory social media, and reading the studies on the effects of spending time there, I decided it was time to do things differently. Instead of individual-centric social media, which encourages the user to curate 'their' feed and post 'their' status, and be the center of 'their' world, I wanted something which trained your brain to support others. I wanted a system which builds friendships, instead of destroying them with too much information (Some people are lovely, when you know less about them). I wanted to be reminded about what I could do for others, not be given more chances to brag or complain.

# Baanabus 

NB These design choices aren't all implemented. The code is still really early stage. This is my thinking and what it is *meant* to be, not what it currently is... 

## Intentional design choices 

* Start with a menu, not a feed

I'm so sick of opening an app or site and being flooded with distractions.

* Multiple views to suit tiredness levels

Complex view for planning out tasks etc; Minimalist "just the next thing" view for after a hard day's work when concentrating is becoming difficult.

* No notifications

Moving from one task to the other is much calmer and more productive without constant disruption.

* Guided reviews

Work through one-at-a-time questions and answers to help you fill in missing information, decide what you want and what you should do, in what order.

* Social tasks

Remind me what i was going to do for someone before I see them

* Schedule Routines

Allocate half an hour in the morning (for example) as 'routine' and be stepped through tasks one at a time, at that hour. Allocate a later hour as 'tasks' and set a location, and maybe assign specific tasks to do them (shout out to Brili, it's a similar idea becuase it's a good idea).

* Questions

You know that thing where you hang up the phone, and kick yourself because you forgot to ask how their dad was doing since he got admitted to hospital? oops. Add questions to your contact records so you can remember what you were going to ask them
Alternatively, add questions to contacts so you have something to ask and be interested in the other person, when there's that awkward lull

* Positive Traits

People like you better when you like them, and it's easier to like them if you make a concerted effort to remember all the good things about them. Contact records store the top 3 positive things about someone (e.g. smart, decisive, good listener) as well as others ... but they have to be positive! 

## Technical data

Baanabus v0 was a Joomla plug-in, but I got sick of modifying it to talk to Joomla and Joomla addins that kept changing every few months and demanding updates, PHP updates, breaking my code... I wanted a service that would improve my life, not add a constance maintenance workload. 

To install the joomla module: 

* Zip up the entire component folder into component_0_3.zip or something
* Open a Joomla 3 backend on a server you prepared earlier ;) 
* Go to Extensions > Manage > Install and drag and drop the .zip file there

Voila! Installed. In your back-end menu, go to Components > Baanabus > Start ... and there you are :) 

This project is still extremely quick'n'dirty, I needed to get it up and running fairly quickly to give me a way to manage lots of bits of info.

The code is all there, help yourself. I don't promise it's all working, or it does what you need. 

Please read the Product Disclosure Statement and determine for yourself whether this product meets your needs... (no, there isn't one, that was a joke).
