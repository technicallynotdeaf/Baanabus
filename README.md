I needed to quit the socmed world of inflamed status updates and dark patterns. 

But my friends! I needed to stay in touch with my friends! And I needed to remember all the things about them that I liked and that they care about. 

I needed something to remind me about things. Like ... I said I would write an article for a friend by Sunday. Or, I was going to message my other friend... but do I remember? nahhh. 

I need a new site.

Instead of everyone else spamming me, and Facebook helping me be addicted... 

I needed a site that supported real world connections. With anti-dark patterns. 

Enter:

# Baanabus 

NB These design choices aren't all implemented. The code is still really early stage. This is my thinking and what it is *meant* to be, not what it currently is... 

## Intentional design choices 

* Start with a menu

I'm so sick of opening an app or site and being flooded with distraction so I don't do what I came there to do

* Multiple interfaces 

Complex view for planning out tasks and stuff; Minimalist view for when it's 4pm, my brain is moosh and I can't remember what I was going to do 

* No notifications

I need to foster a workflow that's about intentionally looking at my next task when I am ready, not interrupts. No interrupts. I need my attention span back...!

## Other features

* Social tasks

Remind me what i was going to do for someone before I see them

* Questions

You know that thing where you hang up the phone, and kick yourself because you forgot to ask how their dad was doing since he got admitted to hospital? oops. Add questions to your contact records so you can remember what you were going to ask them
Alternatively, add questions to contacts so you have something to ask and be interested in the other person, when there's that awkward lull

* Positive Traits

People like you better when you like them, and it's easier to like them if you make a concerted effort to remember all the good things about them. Contact records store the top 3 positive things about someone (e.g. smart, decisive, good listener) as well as others ... but they have to be positive! 


## To use Baanabus

* Zip up the entire component folder into component_0_3.zip or something
* Open a Joomla 3 backend on a server you prepared earlier ;) 
* Go to Extensions > Manage > Install and drag and drop the .zip file there

Voila! Installed. In your back-end menu, go to Components > Baanabus > Start ... and there you are :) 

This project is still extremely quick'n'dirty, I needed to get it up and running fairly quickly to give me a way to manage lots of bits of info.

The code is all there, help yourself. I don't promise it's all working, or it does what you need. 

Please read the Product Disclosure Statement and determine for yourself whether this product meets your needs... (no, there isn't one, that was a joke).
